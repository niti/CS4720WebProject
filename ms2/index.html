				<h2> What will Niti be tracking? </h2>
				<p>
					Student Council is a large organization on grounds, and like any big organization StudCo spends a lot of time on managing and tracking anything from projects to finances. In the past few months serving as  Councilâ€™s Chief Financial Officer I first hand have seen how it difficult it can be.
					<br><br>
					I would like to use this opportunity to create a platform to track finances for all 13 of our presidential committees. This constitutes tracking of  individual purchase requests (PR), the various states that a specific PR goes through and how that factors into to their overall committee budget and lastly how it factors into overall StudCo budget. 
					<br><br>
					I envision this platform to also have a news feed that cycles to provide real-time updates to internal StudCo members particularly Exec on how a specific committee is operating.
